HTML

1.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.

2.
The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.

3.
Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.

4.
You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.

5.
Code for visible HTML content will be placed inside of the <body> element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Animals Around the World</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  
  <h4>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently "Least Concern." There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</h4>

Let's review what you've learned so far:

1.
You can add headings of different sizes using the different headings elements: <h1> through <h6>.

2.
Paragraphs are added with the <p> element.

3.
Unordered lists are created with the <ul> element and list items are added using the <li> element.

4.
Ordered lists are created with the <ol> element and list items are added using the <li> element.

5.
You can add links to your web page using the <a> element - don't forget the href attribute!

6.
Images can be added with the <img> element - don't forget the src attribute!

7.
Images help support visually impaired users when <img> elements include the alt attribute.

8.
You can turn anything into a link by wrapping it with an <a> element.

9.
White space in the HTML file does not affect the positioning of elements in the browser.

10.
The W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation for nested HTML elements.

11.
Comments are used to take notes inside of an HTML file. You can add a comment with <!-- This is a comment -->.




Perfect! We successfully separated structure (HTML) from styling (CSS), but why does the web page look continue to look so bland? The CSS code now lives in a separate CSS file called style.css â€” shouldn't that have worked without issue?

Not exactly. When HTML and CSS code are in separate files, the HTML file must know exactly where the CSS code is kept, otherwise, the styling can't be applied the web page. In order to apply the styling to the web page, we'll have to link the HTML file and the CSS file together.

You can use the <link> element to link the HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:

href - like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
type - this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
rel - this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the <link> element will look like the following:

<link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
Note that in the example above the path to the stylesheet is a URL:

https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css
Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.

If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:

<link href="/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
Using a relative path is very common way of linking a stylesheet.






Great job! You learned how to link an HTML file and a CSS file together.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

1. HTML and CSS are kept in separate files in order to keep code maintainable and readable, as well as keep structure separate from styling.

2. The <style> element allows you to write CSS code within an HTML file.

3. A CSS stylesheet can be linked to an HTML file using the <link> element, which requires three attributes:

href - set equal to the path of the CSS file.
type - set equal to text/css.
rel - set equal to stylesheet.
In this lesson, you learned about the two different places in which you can write CSS code, but you didn't write any CSS code at all.

In the next lesson, you'll learn about the basic structure and syntax of CSS so that you can start using CSS on your own.
